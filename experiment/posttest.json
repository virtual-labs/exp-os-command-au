      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. OS command injection is a security vulnerability.",
        "b": "Correct! OS command injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.",
        "c": "Incorrect. OS command injection is unrelated to system performance.",

      "question": "Which of the following can help mitigate OS command injection?",

        "a": "Running commands with root privileges",
        "b": "Using parameterized commands",
        "c": "Avoiding input validation",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Running commands with root privileges can exacerbate the problem.",
        "b": "Correct! Using parameterized commands helps separate data from command logic.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Input validation is crucial to mitigate injection vulnerabilities.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Directly incorporating user input in commands can lead to injection vulnerabilities."

      "question": "What does the following user input indicate: 'file.txt && cat /etc/passwd'?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This input attempts to list contents and read a sensitive file.",
        "b": "Correct! This input is attempting to execute multiple commands.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This operation includes reading a sensitive file, indicating a potential attack.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The command is syntactically correct but malicious."
