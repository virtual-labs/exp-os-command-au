      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. OS command injection does not improve performance.",
        "b": "Correct! OS command injection can lead to unauthorized data access.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The focus is on unauthorized command execution, not speed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. OS command injection is unrelated to system updates."

      "question": "How can input validation help prevent OS command injection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By allowing all characters",
        "b": "By blocking special characters",
        "c": "By executing commands faster",

      "question": "What is the primary reason OS command injection is dangerous?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It makes the system slower",
        "b": "It can give attackers full system control",
        "c": "It reduces storage capacity",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Speed is not the main concern.",
        "b": "Correct! Attackers can gain full system control via command injection.",

      "question": "In modern secure development, what is the best strategy to handle system commands safely?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Use direct string concatenation with user input",
        "b": "Restrict execution to pre-defined safe commands",
        "c": "Run commands with maximum system privileges",
        "d": "Avoid logging user activity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. String concatenation with user input is unsafe.",
        "b": "Correct! Whitelisting safe commands reduces OS command injection risk.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Running with maximum privileges increases the impact of exploits.",
